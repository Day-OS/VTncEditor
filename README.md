# VTncEditor
 
This CURRENTLY is not useful at all, as I'm still coding the basics of it.
This will be a way to create VTNC files easily.


Things to do:
- [x] Add frames (setting the ms from the transition correctly)
- [x] New file tab
- [ ] Add and delete Colors from pallete
- [ ] Shortcuts
- [x] Zoom
- [ ] Lock the preview at center
- [ ] Style it up
- [ ] Add/Delete Layers
- [ ] Fix most of the bloated code (make it easier to read)
